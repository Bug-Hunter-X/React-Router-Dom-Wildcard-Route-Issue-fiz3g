# React Router Dom Wildcard Route Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using wildcard routes (*) in React Router Dom.  The problem arises from incorrectly handling the wildcard route, leading to unexpected behavior, such as infinite redirect loops or incorrect component rendering.

## Problem Description
The example shows a simple React Router setup with routes for '/', '/about', and a wildcard route ('*'). If the wildcard route isn't managed correctly (e.g., by checking for exact matches or providing fallback content), it can create conflicts with other routes or even cause infinite redirects.

## Solution
The provided solution offers several strategies to handle the wildcard route effectively. These include:

1. **Ordering of Routes**: Ensuring the wildcard route is placed after more specific routes to avoid unintended matches.
2. **Using a 404 Component**: Using a dedicated NotFound component for the wildcard route to handle the cases where no other route matches.
3. **Advanced Route Matching**: Leveraging more advanced techniques in React Router if the routing logic becomes more complex.

This repository aims to educate developers on the importance of correct wildcard route implementation in React Router Dom and provide solutions for common problems.
